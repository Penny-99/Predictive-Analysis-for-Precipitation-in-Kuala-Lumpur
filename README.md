# Predictive Analysis for Precipitation in Kuala Lumpur

## Project Background
Climate change poses significant challenges globally, impacting various facets of our environment and necessitating innovative solutions. One critical aspect that demands attention is the accurate prediction of rainfall, especially in regions prone to weather extremes. In this context, Kuala Lumpur, which is a densely populated urban center, emerges as a pivotal location for the focus of this project. Given its tropical climate and susceptibility to heavy rainfall, the city serves as a crucial case study for enhancing our understanding and predictive capabilities.
As we witness the intensification of climate change, the need for precise and timely rainfall predictions becomes even more urgent to effectively address the challenges that may arise. The urban landscape of Kuala Lumpur faces challenges related to heavy rainfall, including flash floods and infrastructure strain. Accurate rainfall prediction plays a crucial role in disaster preparedness and response, enabling authorities to implement timely measures to safeguard public safety and mitigate the impact on critical infrastructure.
In light of these considerations, this project aims to contribute to the advancement of rainfall prediction methodologies in Kuala Lumpur. This study also aims to empower stakeholders across various sectors, from environmental conservation to urban planning, with insights that foster resilience in the face of changing weather patterns.
